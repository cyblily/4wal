[WIP]
# 4wal
4chan based, pywal dependant, random wallpaper scraper and changer

uses 4chan's read only API to find a random post in a random thread on a random page number

# commands
r <board>  -  set random wallpaper
  
clear      -  clears the screen
  
# TODO:
add options menu for:
  * setting a custom path if desired
  * executing a custom command after wallpaper is saved (to open up from being completely pywal dependant)
  * saving files as their uploaded filenames rather than server filename
  * setting a wallpaper from any board (???)
  
 clean up code, etc
