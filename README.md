# 4wal
4chan based random wallpaper scraper and changer

uses 4chan's read only API to find a random post in a random thread on a random page number

## commands
r <board>  -  set random wallpaper

s <board>  -  select thread 

o          -  show options menu
  
clear      -  clears the screen
  
## TODO:
